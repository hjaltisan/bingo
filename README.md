## Bingo

The aim is to create a website where you can input bingo cards, then select how you want to play (B,I,N, BI, and so forth) by selecting the squares in play on a bingo card. And then either get random numbers, or add in the numbers yourself. The website should then keep track of the status of all cards and be able to both give you a list of the cards closest to winning, as well as notify you when someone has won. It should also be able to take in the id of a bingo card and tell you if it has won (this, round that is, not talking about keeping history here)
